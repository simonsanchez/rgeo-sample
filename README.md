This is a sample script that uses basic features of `rgeo` and `rgeo-geojson`.

It does two things:
* calculates the distance between the centroids of Berkeley, CA and Oakland, CA
* calculates the intersection of the neighborhoods Potrero and Mission District

To run:
```bash
$ bundle install
$ ruby script.rb
```

Output:
```txt
Distance from Berkeley centroid to Oakland centroid: 7.848 miles

Intersection of the neighboorhoods Potrero and Mision District as GeoJSON:
